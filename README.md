### App Requirements and Goals

The Weight Tracking app was developed to help users monitor their daily weight and track their progress toward their weight goals. It is designed to assist users in maintaining a healthy weight by providing an intuitive and easy way to track weight changes over time. The app helps users set weight goals, monitor their progress, and receive notifications to stay motivated. The key features of the app include:

- Account Creation and Login: Users can create an account and log in securely.
- Daily Weight Logging: Users can log their daily weight entries.
- Goal Setting: Users can set and modify their weight goals.
- Progress Tracking: The app displays the user's progress toward their weight goal.
- SMS Notifications: Users receive notifications when they reach their goals.

### Screens and Features
- Login/Sign-Up Screen: Allows users to create an account and log in.
- Home Screen: Displays the user's weight history and current goal, with buttons to add weight and modify the goal.
- Add Weight Screen: Allows users to log their daily weight.

### UI Design and its success 

The UI design was centered around user convenience and ease of use. Large, legible fonts and intuitive placement of elements ensured that the app was accessible and user-friendly. The design included clear navigation and minimal input fields to reduce user effort. Feedback mechanisms like toast messages indicators kept users informed and engaged. The design was successful because it prioritized user convenience and engagement, making the app easy to navigate and use. 


### Techniques and Strategies
The development process was modular, breaking down the app into smaller, manageable components. Session management was implemented to track user login status and user-specific data. SQLite was used for local data storage, ensuring data persistence across sessions. The development was iterative, with continuous testing and refinement based on feedback. These techniques can be applied to future projects by maintaining a modular approach, ensuring efficient session management, and leveraging local databases for data persistence.

### Testing and Debugging

The app underwent thorough testing, including unit testing for individual components, integration testing to ensure correct interactions. Testing was crucial for identifying and fixing bugs, ensuring the app's reliability and functionality. It revealed areas where the user experience could be improved and highlighted the importance of thorough testing before finalizing the app.

### Full App Design and Development Process
The development process required innovative solutions to overcome challenges, such as session management to ensure accurate tracking of user-specific data and UI responsiveness across different screen sizes and resolutions. This ensured a smooth and personalized experience for each user, showcasing advanced development skills and problem-solving abilities.
